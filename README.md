# git-essentials

## This is me being introduced to github by Kalob. Really awesome and a lot to take in really
Started with HTML, then CSS and CSS3, Then JavaScript. Now GitHub.

## Also following the Full Stack Developer Course
When the JavaScript part of the course was done I took a kind of break anbd began working on a program myself. I will eventually attach a link to this but my website www.maxheadroom.uk is up and running and the first part of the maths options is complete and working. It took far longfer tham I planned and is not yet the way I like it but is working.

### (Also loving it)
Not I am on the gihub part of the course. Lot to take in, but I begin to understand how pwerful a tool it is.
